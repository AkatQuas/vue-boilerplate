# Collection of boilerplates in VueJS

what do you expect else?

Most of them are just the skeleton. Nothing big.

## Description about every boilerplate

- [example 1](./example1)

  An obsoleted project build with `Vue^2.5.x`, `vue-router`, `vuex`, `sass`, using vue-cli@2.x.

  It has a flexible script for `rem` calculation suitable for mobile devices.

  Some sh script for copy the project and upload build files to sftp server.

  But I lost the `package.json` file, what a pity.

* [example 2](./example2)

  A simple Vue project generated by `@vue/cli@3.x`, with `element-ui`, `vue-router`, and `vuex`. Using `less` for the style.

  A `noopProsime` for hack the promise chain.

* [example 3](./example3)

  A simple Blog Vue project using `@vue/cli@3.x`.

  Featured libraries are:

  - [iakit](https://github.com/xiaoyann/iakit), several useful widgets for mobile pages.

  [vue-svg-loader](https://github.com/visualfanatic/vue-svg-loader), use for vue to loader svg file.

* [example 4](./example4)

  A Vue project generated using `@vue/cli@4.4`, this is not an SSR project.

  You might need set the puppeteer download registry using

  ```bash
  $ npm config set puppeteer_download_host=https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors
  ```

  Featured libraries are:

  - [vue-meta](https://github.com/nuxt/vue-meta), for setting the **Keywords/Description/Title** meta tags.

  - Using [vue-cli-plugin-dll](https://github.com/fingerpan/vue-cli-plugin-dll) to bundle the common dependencies into dll file. You'd better build dll files before build the project.

  - Using [spa-prerendere](https://github.com/ecowebhosting/spa-prerenderer#usage) to generate SEO-friendly static html files.
